## Purposes:

- Distributed NoSQL database for high availability and scalability.
- Designed for handling large amounts of data across multiple nodes.
- Ideal for applications requiring low latency.

## Characteristics:

- **Distributed Architecture**: No single point of failure.
- **Scalable:** Can handle petabytes of data by adding more nodes.
- **Replication:** Data is replicated across nodes for fault tolerance.
- **Write-Optimized:** Handles high write throughput efficiently.
- **Query Language:** Uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language), similar to SQL.
