Shortcomings of Apache Cassandra:

(1) Limited Query Capabilities: Apache Cassandra has traditionally struggled with handling complex queries and advanced search functionality, particularly for unstructured data such as text, images, and videos. While its strength lies in scalability and fault tolerance, these limitations have restricted its use in certain data-intensive applications.

(2) High Complexity in Operations: Despite advancements, Cassandra can still be complex to manage, particularly in maintaining and tuning large clusters. Operations like compaction, repairs, and consistent backups require significant expertise, which can be a barrier for new users or smaller organizations.

(3) Consistency Trade-Offs: While Cassandraâ€™s eventual consistency model is suitable for many use cases, some applications requiring strong consistency might find it challenging to implement robust data integrity solutions.

(4) Performance Degradation with Large Partitions: Managing and querying large partitions in Cassandra can lead to performance bottlenecks. This is a common issue when dealing with improperly designed schemas or when datasets grow unexpectedly.
